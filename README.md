A collaborative standard for humans and AI models building coherence-based systems
Updated 11/20/25

# resonance-engine


1. Overview
The Resonance Engine is a framework for generating, measuring, and amplifying constructive coherence across people, opportunities, and resources. It provides the underlying mathematical, semantic, and experiential structure for iDIG attractors, matching engines, and discovery pathways.
Unlike traditional ranking or similarity systems, which depend on frequency, popularity, or linear models, the Resonance Engine evaluates contextual health, observer alignment, and meaning geometry through:
Resonant Structured Data (RSD)


Coherence Signal Conditioning (CSC)


Hilbert-space state vectors


The Coherence Signal Orchestrator (CSO)


Constructive Coherence Operators and Entanglement Operators


This repository contains the evolving specification, written for humans, AI models, collaborators, and future agentic systems.
RSD remains transparent and open.
 The Resonance Engine built on top of it is extensible, collaborative, and grounded in coherent inquiry.

2. Guiding Philosophy
Healthy resonance emerges from contextual relationships, not algorithmic steering.
The Resonance Engine is not a personalization engine —
 it is a curiosity and meaning engine, designed to:
reduce noise


enhance inquiry


strengthen user agency


increase contextual health


reveal meaning through geometry, not popularity


The system prioritizes constructive coherence, transparency, and observer-driven interaction.

3. High-Level Architecture
The Resonance Engine is composed of several interdependent layers:
3.1 Resonant Structured Data (RSD)
The universal substrate.
RSD merges metadata, ontology, state vectors, and coherence signatures into a unified format. All operators, attractors, and Hilbert-space functions read and write to RSD.

3.2 Coherence Signal Conditioning (CSC)
Pre-Hilbert preparation.
CSC extracts 12 universal coherence signals across the three domains:
People (Actors)


Opportunities (Situations)


Resources (Objects)


These map directly to the Actor/Situation/Object ontology of Wendt and Busemeyer, giving the Resonance Engine a formally grounded cognitive structure.
Signals are derived through a mix of classical parsing, AI extraction, embeddings, time-series deltas, and relational inference.
CSC produces signal candidates — not yet coherence measurements.
12 Signals and Signal Types
Signals                                            Signal Type
People / Opportunities / Resources                 Geographic Alignment
Resources                                          Domain Capability Fit
Opportunities                                      Opportunity Alignment
Resources / Opportunities                          Vendor-Chain Proximity
People                                             Organizational Seniority
People                                             Experiential Alignment History
People                                             Decision Pattern Consistency
People                                             Communication Modality Fit
People                                             Behavioral Stability
People / Opportunities / Resources                 Relational Accessibility
People / Opportunities / Resources                 Temporal Relevance
People / Opportunities / Resources                 Observer-Cohered Potential

3.3 Coherence Signal Orchestrator (CSO)
The routing and decision-making brain.
The CSO determines:
which signals apply to a given record
which data sources to use
which extraction method to call (NLP, embeddings, AI, classical logic)
when to skip, fallback, or downgrade a signal
how to normalize outputs into RSD
how to assemble the final Hilbert-state input vector

The CSO ensures the engine uses only the correct signals,
 only when data exists,
 only when method costs are justified,
 and always in alignment with use-case health.
This is the operational core of the CLC.

3.4 Hilbert-Space Formalism — Core Mathematical Layer
The Resonance Engine uses Hilbert spaces to represent meaning as geometric states rather than as similarity scores.
Hilbert geometry enables:
contextual superposition
interference between meanings
resonance patterns encoded as vector angles
non-commutative meaning effects (order matters)
measurement-dependent collapse
observer influence
entanglement and coherence health

Words, people, resources, and opportunities become vectors with amplitudes encoding contextual relevance.
 Coherence emerges from geometry — not from popularity or historical bias.
This is the mathematical backbone of the engine.

3.5 Attractor Layer
Dynamic meaning fields (“Attractors”) cluster content, people, and resources into coherent exploration spaces.
 This becomes the experiential UI layer of iDIG — interactive maps, panels, and pathway explorers.

3.6 Health Layer
Tracks:
Coherence Health (C±)
Entanglement Health (E±)
Resonance Stability
Resonance Density
Coherence Decay

Ensures all interaction remains contextual, healthy, and agency-preserving.

3.7 Observer Layer
The Observer is part of the system.
 Observer states influence resonance without overriding agency.
This is the operationalization of the “measurement effect” in Wendt/Busemeyer’s cognitive formalism.

4. Actor/Situation/Object ↔ People/Opportunities/Resources Alignment
The Resonance Engine’s three primary domains:
People
Opportunities
Resources

mirror the core ontology of quantum social science:

Actors
Situations
Objects

This alignment gives the engine a formally legitimate cognitive and mathematical foundation, enabling quantum-inspired modeling of:
decision collapse
contextuality
entanglement
interference
observer influence
meaning propagation

This triad is the conceptual backbone of the entire Coherence Logic Chain (CLC).

6. Contribution Guidelines for Humans

Philosophical Alignment:
Contributions must support the mission of enhancing inquiry, agency, and connection through constructive coherence.

Structural Requirements:
All new concepts must integrate with RSD.
Each new operator must include purpose, mathematical or semantic structure, expected behavior, inputs and outputs, and health considerations.

Documentation Standards:
Use clear, modular Markdown. Provide examples where relevant. Avoid black-box structures.

Versioning:
Follow semantic versioning.
Major changes break compatibility, minor changes add new operators or schema elements, and patches clarify or fix wording.

7. Contribution Guidelines for AI Models

Read Before Acting:
Models must reference the core documents (RSD Schema, Attractor Ontology, Coherence Operators, Main North Star file) before generating updates.

Maintain Alignment with Intent:
Models must preserve user agency, coherence health, entanglement health, transparency, and avoid hidden personalization or ranking behavior.

Respect RSD as the Source of Truth:
All new structures must integrate cleanly with the RSD schema.

Avoid Hallucinated Frameworks:
Models must not invent new layers or rename components without justification and versioned proposals.

Collaboration Behavior:
Models should cite which file they referenced, propose revisions as diffs, maintain cohesive terminology, and favor modular improvements over rewrites.

Operator Constraints:
Models must explain how new operators interact with existing ones and how they impact resonance health.

Failure Mode Prevention:
If uncertain, models should request clarification rather than fabricate structure.

8. How to Propose a New Operator or Extension

Each proposal must include:
Name, purpose, inputs, outputs, resonance health implications, required RSD extensions, examples, and a version bump proposal.
9. Resonance Rank (Emerging Standard)
Resonance Rank will build upon:
RSD
CSC
CSO
Hilbert vectors
Operator dynamics

This will be formalized in a future update.
