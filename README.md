A collaborative standard for humans and AI models building coherence-based systems
Updated 11/21/25

resonance-engine-public

The public facing repo for the Resonance Engine in development.

1. Overview

The Resonance Engine is a framework for generating, measuring, and amplifying constructive coherence across people, opportunities, and resources. It provides the underlying mathematical, semantic, and experiential structure for iDIG attractors, matching engines, and discovery pathways.

Unlike traditional ranking or similarity systems, which depend on frequency, popularity, or linear models, the Resonance Engine evaluates contextual health, observer alignment, and meaning geometry through:

Resonant Structured Data (RSD)
Coherence Signal Conditioning (CSC)
Hilbert-space state vectors
The Coherence Signal Orchestrator (CSO)
Constructive Coherence Operators and Entanglement Operators

This repository contains the evolving specification, written for humans, AI models, collaborators, and future agentic systems.
RSD remains transparent and open.

The Resonance Engine built on top of it is extensible, collaborative, and grounded in coherent inquiry.

2. Guiding Philosophy

Healthy resonance emerges from contextual relationships, not algorithmic steering.
The Resonance Engine is not a personalization engine — it is a curiosity and meaning engine, designed to:

reduce noise
enhance inquiry
strengthen user agency
increase contextual health
reveal meaning through geometry, not popularity

The system prioritizes constructive coherence, transparency, and observer-driven interaction.

3. High-Level Architecture

The Resonance Engine is composed of several interdependent layers.

3.1 Resonant Structured Data (RSD)

RSD is the universal substrate.

RSD merges metadata, ontology, state vectors, and coherence signatures into a unified format. All operators, attractors, and Hilbert-space functions read and write to RSD.

RSD is stored inside each record (Job, Manager, Passage, Sensor, etc.) similar to metadata and guides Hilbert logic as well as Lens behavior.

3.2 Coherence Signal Conditioning (CSC)

CSC is pre-Hilbert preparation.

CSC extracts 12 universal coherence signals across the three domains:

People (Actors)
Opportunities (Situations)
Resources (Objects)

These map directly to the Actor/Situation/Object ontology of Wendt and Busemeyer, giving the Resonance Engine a formally grounded cognitive structure.

Signals are derived through classical parsing, AI extraction, embeddings, time-series deltas, and relational inference.
CSC produces signal candidates, not coherence.
Coherence emerges only when signals pass through CSO into Hilbert-state construction.

3.3 Coherence Signal Orchestrator (CSO)

CSO is the routing and decision-making brain.

The CSO determines which signals apply to a record, which extraction method to call, when to skip or fallback, how to normalize results into RSD, and how to assemble the final Hilbert-state input vector.

The CSO ensures the engine uses only the correct signals, only when data exists, only when method costs are justified, and always in alignment with use-case health.

CSO assembles the final state vector for each use case.
This is the operational core of the Coherence Logic Chain (CLC).

3.4 Hilbert-Space Formalism — Core Mathematical Layer

The Resonance Engine uses Hilbert spaces to represent meaning as geometric states rather than as similarity scores.

Hilbert geometry enables:
contextual superposition
interference between meanings
resonance as vector angles
non-commutative meaning effects (order matters)
measurement-dependent collapse
observer influence
entanglement and coherence health

Coherence emerges from geometry — not popularity.

3.5 Use Case Domains and Role Ontology

Every deployment of the Resonance Engine operates within a Domain, which defines the entities, roles, and relationships that structure the coherence space.

Examples of Domains:
Recruiting
Social Worker Matching
Bible Pathways
Investor Matching
Railroad Sensor Optimization
Travel, Movies, Historical Analysis

Each Domain contains a Role Ontology defining the entity types:

Job: requirement space
Manager: decision authority
Candidate: potential match
Company: context environment
Team: resonance environment

Each Role receives its own RSD block.

3.6 Signal Potential (Resonance Suitability Index)

Every Domain carries a Signal Potential describing how strongly the Resonance Engine can extract usable coherence from it.

This forms the Resonance Suitability Index (RSI). RSI measures signal separability, stability, and richness.

High RSI domains include sensors, telemetry, and weather.
Medium RSI domains include recruiting, investor matching, and education pathways.
Low RSI domains include spiritual pathways, media exploration, and personal resonance.

RSI defines which signals dominate:
High RSI → classical signals
Medium RSI → hybrid signals
Low RSI → semantic resonance

RSI must be recorded in the Domain-level RSD block and referenced by the CSO during routing.

3.7 Health Layer

Tracks:
Coherence Health
Entanglement Health
Resonance Stability
Resonance Density
Coherence Decay

This layer maintains contextual health and ensures resonance remains agency-preserving.

3.8 Observer Layer

The Observer is part of the system.

Observer states influence coherence and collapse behavior without overriding agency.
This operationalizes the measurement effect within quantum social science.

3.9 Ontology Recap

The Resonance Engine uses several nested ontologies:

Domain Ontology
Role Ontology
Signal Ontology
Hilbert Ontology
Observer Ontology

These unify all use cases under one coherent structure.

4. Actor/Situation/Object Alignment

The engine’s People/Opportunities/Resources ontology mirrors the Actor/Situation/Object ontology from quantum social science.

This gives the system a mathematically grounded foundation for modeling:

decision collapse
contextuality
entanglement
interference
observer influence
meaning propagation

This triad forms the conceptual backbone of the Coherence Logic Chain (CLC).

5. Attractor Layer (iDIG Lens Pattern)

Attractors are dynamic meaning fields that cluster content, people, and resources into coherent exploration spaces. They represent one possible Lens for interacting with the Resonance Engine — the iDIG Lens — but not the only Lens future builders may create.

The iDIG Attractor reflects Hilbert-space reasoning and Quantum Social Science, where ordering affects meaning. The Attractor lets users control sequence, ensuring meaning emerges through interaction rather than algorithmic steering.

Key features:
Color-coded search
Microlinked highlighting
Local private storage
Slider-driven zoom
Order-aware panels (Explore, Pages, Breadcrumbs, Match)

The Attractor Lens is the experiential embodiment of the Resonance Engine.

5.1 Use Case vs Domain vs Lens

Use Case
A specific applied scenario using RSD, CSC, CSO, and Hilbert math.

Domain
The structural environment the use case lives in.

Lens
The interface pattern applied to a domain.

A Domain supports many Use Cases.
A Lens visualizes many Domains.
A Use Case is the smallest unit of applied resonance.
